# A Social Network with React

### [Backend has moved to another repository](https://github.com/pouryapb/FaceAct-backend)

FaceAct was a hobby project inspired by instagram and uses React + material-ui for frontend and nodejs + express for backend.

to run this project after downloading the source code you should run frontend and backend seperately:

```bash
cd ./backend
npm install
npm start
```
```bash
cd ./frontend
npm install
npm start
```
afterwards FaceAct is accessible through http://localhost:3000

port 3000 is used by front and 8000 is used by back so they should be unoccupied to run the project
