# A Social Network with React

This project was built as the final project of internet engineering course in guilan university by Pourya Pourbagheri and Mahdi Pourtalebi

FaceAct was inspired by instagram and uses React and material-ui for frontend and nodejs and express for backend.

to run this project after downloading the source code you should run frontend and backend seperately:

```bash
cd ./backend
npm install
npm start
```
```bash
cd ./frontend
npm install
npm start
```
after that FaceAct is accessible through http://localhost:3000

port 3000 is used by front and 8000 is used by back so they should be free to run the project
