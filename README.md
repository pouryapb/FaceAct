# A Social Network with React

This project was built as the final project of internet engineering course in guilan university by [Pourya Pourbagheri](https://github.com/pouryapb) and [Mahdi Pourtalebi](https://github.com/mpowend)

FaceAct was a hobby project inspired by Instagram and uses `React` and `material-ui` for frontend and `nodejs` and `express` for backend.

To run this project after downloading the source code you should run frontend and backend seperately:

```bash
# backend is loacated in root directory
npm install
npm start
```

```bash
cd ./frontend
npm install
npm start
```

After that FaceAct is accessible through http://localhost:3000

Port `3000` is used by front and `8000` is used by back so they should be free to run the project

> [!NOTE]  
> This project is also hosted at [this url](https://faceact-3-c6420837.deta.app/) but there is no guarantee it will be up in a few months after updating this readme :>
